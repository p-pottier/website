#### Why is this campaign needed?
[Registered Reports](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports) implement peer review prior to data collection. This format alleviates numerous questionable research practices by accepting articles before results exist. However, despite their importance in increasing the transparency and reliability of research findings, they are rarely implemented in ecology and evolutionary biology journals. Many of these journals have been [contacted during a previous campaign](https://hsfraser.wordpress.com/registered-report-petition/), but ignored our call to implement Registered Reports. This campaign aims to demonstrate that Registered Reports have more support than ever, and to show the journals we are not going away simply because they ignored us last time. 

#### What happens next
At the upcoming [SORTEE conference](https://www.sortee.org/events/), we will send [letters](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/z5288536_ad_unsw_edu_au/EWub6kuVB-pHpxJ88VKU0DkBxxj8HfEl63yKnYHykG0Zhg?e=qFx0vgand) to the editors of [various journals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10jxNH0g3SKqTSjO0UfKMAxZsJAxhRrzBl9u5zfqVltQ/edit?usp=sharing) in our field asking them to adopt the Registered Reports format (Note: the letter content may change slightly prior to sending. Please notify us if you wish to edit the text or would like to see a final draft before sending). Your name will be listed in the letters, and we will also reference this page for any extra signatures we collect after the hackathon is completed. 

#### How else can I help?
Please join us at the [SORTEE conference hackathon](https://www.sortee.org/events/) to help email the letters out!

#### More resources
Not an ecologist or evolutionary biologist? The [Registered Reports Now! campaign](https://osf.io/3wct2/) calls for a wider implementation of Registered Reports.
